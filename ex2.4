#Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
#width = 17
#height = 12.0
#For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).



width = 17
height = 12.0

print(round(width//2))
print(round(width/2.0))
print(round(height/3))
print(round(1+2*5))
