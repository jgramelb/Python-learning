#Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the program:

hrs = input("EnterHours:")
hrs = float(hrs)

try:	
	rate = input("Enter Rate:")
	rate = float(rate)
    
except:
    print("Error, please enter numeric input")
    quit()

regtime = rate * hrs
overtime = (hrs-40)*rate*1.5

if hrs <= 40:
    print(regtime)
else:
    print(regtime + overtime)
