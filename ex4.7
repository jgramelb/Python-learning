#Exercise 7: Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and returns a grade as a string.

score = input("Enter score:")
try:
	score = float(score)

except:
    print("error, please enter numeric input")
    quit()
     
def computegrade(score):
	if score > 1.0:
    	return "Please choose a number between 0.0 and 1.0"
	elif score >= 0.9:
    	return "A"
	elif score >= 0.8:
    	return "B"
	elif score >= 0.7:
    	return "C"
	elif score >= 0.6:
    	return "D"
	elif score >= 0:
    	return "F"
	elif score < 0:
    	return "Please choose a positive number between 0.0 and 1.0"
s = computegrade(score)
print(s)
