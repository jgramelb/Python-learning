#     8.5 Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. 
#     When you find a line that starts with 'From ' 
#     like the following line:
#  From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
#     You will parse the From line using split() and 
#     print out the second word in the line 
#     (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message). 
#     Then print out a count at the end.
